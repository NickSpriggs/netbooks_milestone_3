# Milestone Back-End Project

The following project was my attempt to create a book recommendation website for users based on the movies they like. 
This project makes use of HTML, CSS, Python, and Javascript.

# UX

My goal was to create a website that would allow users interested in reading more to find books based
on their existing movie viewing habits. Specifically my goals were to:
    - Allow unregistered users to search for films and view their respective book recommendations
    - Allow registered users to add films and recommendations to the site database. 
        - Additionally only the admin and user who created the films/recommendation could edit/delete 
          from the database. 

## User Stories

-   #### First Time User Goals

    1. As a First Time User, I want to easily locate different films, either by title or genre. 
    2. As a First Time User, I want to easily find the recommendations for the films. 
    3. As a First Time User, I would like the option to register for an account.   

-   #### Returning User Goals

    1. As a Returning User, I want to be able to login to my account.
    2. As a Returning User, I would like to add films to the site so that others might offer 
    reading suggestions based on my preferences. 
    3. As a Returning User, I would like to be able to upload my own book suggestions for certain films.
